Not she who burns brightly and fizzles to nothing, a foolish end. And how could I? After all, she is gone. You know that well. Your heart knows why.\n\nNo, it is not her. It is the one who assures balance. The one who whispers guidance to her far and many. You know of whom I speak. And you know why this concerns you.\n\nI have seen from afar the infested worlds to which you have had your gates carried. Our gates. Our worlds. And I have, I suppose in an uncharacteristically unpleasant mood, shared this information with my acquaintance some time ago.\n\nOh, brother, I simply could not have known what measures she would take. How far she would carry whispers of your tainted worlds that bear our treasured opus. You see, her disciples have already acted. They have already claimed a gate from a dead world.\n\nIf only I had known sooner, brother. Perhaps I could have warned you before they could present a danger to everything you have worked for. Before they might grant me the passage you have stolen from me.\n\nI suppose you could use the gate they have taken. To unweave it from the other side would leave you stranded and doomed to the sickness of the black sea, of course.\n\nBut perhaps you have a chance.\n\nIt seems fortune has afforded you a brief opportunity. They are approaching this world. She has told them where to find it, but they cannot see it. Perhaps you can bring the vessel, and the gate it carries, back to this world before the sickness would claim you.\n\nThe vessel would not be surrendered without a fight. It would be bloody. I'm sure you are conflicted, but they will soon depart from their failed search.\n\nYou have a choice to make, brother, and time is short. What will you do?\n\n<style=cIsHealth>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</style>",
